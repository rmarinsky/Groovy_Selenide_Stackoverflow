# Groovy_Selenide_Stackoverflow

How would you test login/registration UI functionality of your favorite website
(e.g. https://stackoverflow.com)?
Steps:
Choose your favorite website which has a login/registration flow.
Write test cases for a given part of the functionality. It can be only login flow, or
only registration flow, or both. Feel free to choose.
Implement automated tests for up to three test cases from this list.
Please, note that rather than coming up with a complex but not finished solution it's
better to do simple but finished and well-documented solution.
At relayr, we mainly use Python for test automation projects. However, feel free to
choose any programming language you prefer.
Just stick to one or two frameworks and do not spend more than 1-2 hours of your
time. We are mostly interested in seeing the way you approach the problem and your
basic coding skills.
